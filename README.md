In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
## Analyse
### Tumor Response to Treatment
![tumor_response](/Pymaceuticals/Charts/tumor_response_to_treatment.png "Tumor Response to Treatment")

This scatter plot shows how the tumor volume changes over time for 25 mice in each treatment group. 
The tumor volume mean of all groups is 45 mm3 when the study begins.
After five days, mice treated with Capomulin show a tumor size reduction while the three others treatements show a tumor size increase (44,27 mm3 vs 47,13 mm3 for Placebo treatment). 

This initial trend keeps its initial course throughout the total duration of the study. Fourty five days after the start of the test, the tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin is 36,24 mm3 compared to 68,08 mm3 for mice treated with Placebo. Infubinol and Ketapril have the same results as Placebo.

In this study, Capomulin is the only treatment which allows to decrease the tumor volume (-8,76 mm3).
## Metastatic Response to Treatment

This scatter plot shows how the number of metastatic sites changes over time for each treatment.
The 25 mice per drug treatment group have an average of 0.0 metastatic sites when the study starts.
In each group, the metastatic sites increase but after 45 days, the average is significantly lower for Capomulin and Infubinol (respectively 1.48 and 2.11 vs 3.27 for Placebo). In conclusion, the Capomulin shows higher efficacy in limiting cancer spreading.

## Survival Rates

This scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).
After 45 days treatment, 84% of mice (21) in the Capomulin group treatment are still alive while the survival rate for Placebo group is 44% (11 mice). Survival rates for Ketapril and Infubinol are similarly to the Placebo treatment.

Capomulin is the drug presenting the higher survival rate during the treatment.

## Summary Bar Graph

This bar graph compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
It confirms that the only drug which allows to decrease the tumor volume is Capomulin (-19% vs +51% for Placebo). Infubinol and Ketapril have very close results to Placebo (46% and 57%).

## Conclusion and perspectives

Capomulin has the highest chance of success as an anti-cancer pharmaceuticals for Pymaceuticals Inc. During this 45 days study, this drug-based pharmaceuticals reduced mice's tumor volume (-19%), slown down the spread of cancer, and increased the survival rate. These results were significantly better than the other drugs treatment, however, statistical analyzes should be done in order to show if the differences are statistically significant or not. Error bars representing standard error of the mean are not enough to prove that.

Another alternative for an anti-cancer pharmaceuticals is the Ramicane drug because the data presented shows that it allowed to reduce tumor volume by 22%.
