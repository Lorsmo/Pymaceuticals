In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
## Analyse
### Tumor Response to Treatment
![tumor_response](/Pymaceuticals/Charts/tumor_response_to_treatment.png "Tumor Response to Treatment")

This scatter plot shows how the tumor volume changes over time for 25 mice in each treatment group. 
Each tumor volume mean is 45 mm3 whan the study begin.
After five days, mice treated with Capomulin treatment have their tumor size reduced compare to tumor's mice treated with the three other treatements which had grown (44,27 mm3 vs 47,13 mm3 for Placebo treatment). 

The difference between Capomulin and the three others treatments keep increasing throughout the treatment; 45 days after the start of the test, the tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin is 36,24 mm3 while is 68,08 mm3 for mice treated with Placebo. Infubinol and Ketapril have the same results as Placebo.

In this study, Capomulin is the only one which allow to decrease the tumor volume (-8,76 mm3)
## Metastatic Response to Treatment

This scatter plot show how the number of metastatic sites changes over time for each treatment.
The 25 mice per drug treatment group have an average of 0.0 metastatic sites when the study starts.
In each group, the metastatic sites increase but after 45 days, the average is significantly lower for Capomulin and Infubinol (respectively 1.48 and 2.11 vs 3.27 for Placebo). So, the Capomulin is the most interesting in order to limit cancer spreading.

## Survival Rates

This scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).
After 45 days treatment, 84% of the mice (21) in the Capomulin group treatment are still alive when the survival rate for Placebo group is 44% (11 mice). Survival rates for Ketapril and Infubinol are significantly as low as the Placebo one.

Capomulin is the drug with the best survival rate during the treatment.

## Summary Bar Graph
![tumor_change](/Pymaceuticals/Charts/tumor_change.png "Tumor Change")

This bar graph compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
It confirms that the only drug which allows to decrease the tumor volume is Capomulin (-19% vs +51% for Placebo). Infubinol and Ketapril have very close results to Placebo (46% and 57%).

## Conclusion and perspectives

Capomulin could be an anti-cancer pharmaceuticals very interesting for Pymaceuticals Inc. During this 45 days study, this drug-based pharmaceuticals reduced mice's tumor volume (-19%), slown down the spread of cancer, and increased the survival rate. These results were significantly better than the other drugs treatment, however, statistical analyzes should be done in order to show if the differences are statistically significant or not. Error bars representing standard error of the mean are not enough to prove that.

If the Ramicane pharmaceuticals is not used as anti-cancer pharmaceuticals yet, the company should take a look on it because this drug allowed to reduced tumor volume by 22%.
